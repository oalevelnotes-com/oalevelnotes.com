					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I am Eva an expert in content writing. 
 
I enjoy solving people’s problems and make them happy. That is what I have been doing for many years now. 
I have been writing since I was 12 years old and never knew it would turn out to be a full-time career. I have also been able to manage several projects that involves writing. And I worked in three organizations as a volunteer to assist people.My passion has always been to help people succeed. And I go the extra mile to make that happen. 
I enjoy writing books and have helped people from countries like Australia. 
I work with a service provider whose mission is to provide quality writing and make people happy. In fact, many people come to me for help on a daily basis because they know I always deliver. And I will continue to provide nothing but quality to build trust like I have been doing for the past few years.
